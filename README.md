# Ehanched Demo CPU
This is an enhanced version of my original CPU.  This enhancement adds stack management, function call and return instructions, and more data transfer instructions.  It also lays the framework for implementing system interrupts. For this CPU to work, you will need the latest version of [Logisim Evolution (Holy Cross Edition)](https://github.com/kevinawalsh/logisim-evolution) (4.0.4+).  The DemoCPU.cpu file is for use with [customasm](https://github.com/hlorenzi/customasm).

BIN files are raw binary files that can be loaded directly into RAM through the "Load Memory Image..." option.  HEX files hold the exact same data in text format so that it's easier to see what's in it.  ASM files hold a human-readable assembly code of said program.
