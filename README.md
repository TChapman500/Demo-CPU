# Restored Demo CPU
A restoration of the original CPU to it's previous working condition from before I attempted to add the call and return instructions to the CPU.  The CPU has been optimized to run faster and the component layout has been cleaned-up a bit.  All instructions will take 1 or 2 clock cycles to complete.

For this CPU to work, you will need the latest version of [Logisim Evolution (Holy Cross Edition)](https://github.com/kevinawalsh/logisim-evolution) (4.0.1+).

DAT files are raw binary files that can be loaded directly into RAM through the "Load Memory Image..." option.  PROG files hold the exact same data in text format so that it's easier to see what's in it.  ASM files hold a human-readable assembly code of said program.
