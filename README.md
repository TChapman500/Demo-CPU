# Demo-CPU
The absolute original CPU in it's final state after I attempted to add the call and return instructions to the CPU.  Yes, I finally found the original CPU.  This is not a remake of the original, but the original itself!

For this CPU to "work", you will need the original [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html), as this CPU was made with the original Logisim.  You will also need to download all of the included circuits.

The Fibonnacci.dat file is the raw binary that you can run on a working version of the CPU.  The Fibonacci (no extension) file is a logisim-compatible text file that can be loaded into RAM.
