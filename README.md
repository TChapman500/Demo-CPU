# Ehanched Demo CPU
If you would like to extend the demo CPU, fork this repository and start working on this branch (restored branch).  Once your enhancements are done, create a pull request.

## Rules for Pull Requests
All pull requests for the enhanced CPU will result in the circuit of that pull request being tested against the following rules.  Failing this test will result in a closed pull request.
1.	Do not make a pull request to the preserved or restored branches.  Only make pull requests to this branch.
2.	All instructions that you add must be working properly before any pull requests are made.
3.	The [original instruction set](https://github.com/TChapman500/Demo-CPU/tree/enhanced/CPU%20Instruction%20Set.md) must be preserved and functional.
